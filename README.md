# NetWinner - Tennis Match Prediction

NetWinner is a machine learning model designed to predict tennis match outcomes by considering various factors, including player performance, playing surface, and tournament level. This model provides the probability of a player winning based on the analyzed features.


## Overview

Optimize NetWinner to predict tennis match results effectively by incorporating player performance metrics such as aces, double faults, and more. Additionally, take into account playing surface and tournament level to enhance the accuracy of predictions.

## Data Source

Thanks to Jeff Sackmann for providing the ATP tennis dataset, which has been instrumental in training and testing our machine learning models. The dataset can be found at [Jeff Sackmann's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp).

## Machine Learning Models

NetWinner utilizes two main machine learning models for prediction:

### 1. Logistic Regression

The logistic regression model is employed to analyze and predict tennis match outcomes based on a set of input features. This model is trained to understand the relationships between different factors and estimate the probability of a player winning.

### 2. Neural Network

The neural network model is employed to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the input data. By leveraging neural networks, NetWinner aims to enhance its predictive capabilities, especially when dealing with intricate relationships among various features.

## Usage

To use NetWinner for tennis match prediction, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. This may include Python libraries for machine learning, such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

2. **Input Data:**
   Prepare input data with relevant player statistics, playing surface details, and tournament information.

3. **Run the Models:**
   Utilize the provided scripts or code snippets to run both the logistic regression and neural network models on your input data.

4. **Interpret Results:**
   Examine the model predictions to understand the likelihood of a player winning based on the input features.
